This code trains a neural network with TensorFlow and Keras to label clothing images on the basis of pixel values from data.csv. It preprocesses data, trains a deep model, tests its performance, and displays the outcomes.

Importing Libraries:-

pandas and numpy for data handling.
tensorflow and keras for deep learning.
seaborn and matplotlib.pyplot for visualization.
sklearn.model_selection for splitting the dataset.
sklearn.preprocessing for scaling features.
sklearn.metrics for metrics to evaluate.

Enabling GPU Acceleration:-

The code looks for available GPUs and allows for memory expansion to improve training efficiency.

Loading and Preprocessing Data:-

The CSV file is read into a Pandas DataFrame.
The first column is presumed to be labels (y), and the remaining columns are pixel values (X).
Pixel values are scaled (0-255 to 0-1).
The dataset is divided into training (80%) and validation (20%) sets.

Defining the Neural Network Architecture:-

A sequential model is initialized with three layers:
Input layer: 128 neurons, ReLU activation.
Hidden layer: 64 neurons, ReLU activation.
Output layer: 10 neurons (one for each clothing class), softmax activation.

Compiling the Model:-

The model is compiled with the Adam optimizer.
The loss function is sparse categorical cross-entropy (for multi-class classification).
Accuracy is selected as the metric for evaluation.

Training the Model:-

The model is trained for 10 epochs at a batch size of 32.
Validation data is given to monitor performance during training.

Evaluating the Model:-

The trained model is tested on the validation set.
Validation accuracy is printed.

Generating Predictions:-

Predictions are generated on the validation set.
The class with the highest probability is taken as the predicted label.

Visualizing the Confusion Matrix:-

A confusion matrix is calculated to display correct and incorrect classifications.
A heatmap is plotted with seaborn to visualize classification performance.

Printing the Classification Report:-

A classification report is printed with precision, recall, and F1-score for each category.
