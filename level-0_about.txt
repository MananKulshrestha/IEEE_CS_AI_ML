This code investigates and displays the dataset in data.csv, which has pixel color values between 0 and 255. The dataset is presumed to have grayscale images of 28x28 pixels, with the labels in the first column.

Importing Libraries:-

pandas is utilized for data manipulation and CSV file reading.
numpy is utilized for numerical computations
matplotlib.pyplot is utilized for displaying the images.

Loading the Dataset:-


The data from the CSV file data.csv is imported into a Pandas DataFrame (df).

Basic Information Regarding the Dataset:-

The dataset's shape (df.shape) is printed to know the number of samples (rows) and features + label (columns)
The first few rows of the dataset (df.head()) are printed.

Displaying Sample Images:-

A 10-sample image figure is ploted using matplotlib.
Each image is reshaped into a 28x28 matrix and plotted in grayscale (cmap='gray').
The caption of every image is fetched from the first column and shown as the title
The images are shown in a 2x5 grid.

Confirming Pixel Value Range:-

The pixel values of a sample image are pulled out and reshaped into 28x28
The minimum and maximum pixel values are printed to verify that they are in the expected grayscale range (0-255)
