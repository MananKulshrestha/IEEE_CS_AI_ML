This code uses machine learning to predict clothing images on the basis of pixel values from data.csv. It preprocessed the dataset, trained a logistic regression model, checked its performance, and implemented SHAP for Explainable AI.

Importing Libraries:-

import pandas and numpy for handling data.
import matplotlib.pyplot and seaborn for visualization.
import sklearn.model_selection for dividing the dataset into training and test sets.
import sklearn.linear_model for training logistic regression.
import sklearn.metrics for checking accuracy, classification reports, confusion matrices, and log loss.
shap for Explainable AI to interpret feature importance.

Loading and Examining the Dataset:-

The CSV dataset is loaded into a Pandas DataFrame.
The shape of the dataset and the first few rows are shown.

Mapping Label Numbers to Apparel Types:-

A dictionary is defined to map label numbers (0-9) to apparel types like T-shirt, Trouser, Dress, etc.

Displaying Sample Images with Labels:-

Five sample images for each type of apparel are shown.
Every image is resized to 28x28 pixels and displayed in grayscale.

Data Preprocessing:-

The label column is isolated as the target variable y.
Pixel values are divided by 255 to normalize them between 0 and 1.

Splitting the Dataset:-

Dataset is divided into training (80%) and test (20%) sets.

Training a Logistic Regression Model:-

Multinomial logistic regression model is trained on lbfgs solver with a max of 1000 iterations.

Evaluating the Model:-

Predictions are generated on the test set.
Accuracy and log loss are calculated.
A classification report is produced.

Visualizing the Confusion Matrix:-

Heatmap of confusion matrix is created using seaborn to display patterns of misclassification.

Explainable AI with SHAP:-

SHAP values are calculated to explain feature importance.
A bar plot shows the most significant pixels contributing to classification.
