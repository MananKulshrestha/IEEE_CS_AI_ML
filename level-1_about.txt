This code executes a thorough examination of data.csv, which stores grayscale pixel intensity values between 0 and 255. It analyzes the dataset's organization, tests for missing values, calculates pixel statistics, displays sample images, and prints a correlation heatmap.

Importing Libraries:-

pandas is applied for data manipulation and loading.
numpy is utilized for numerical computing.
matplotlib.pyplot is utilized to display images and graphs.
seaborn is utilized to design a heatmap to perform correlation analysis.

Loading the Dataset:-

The dataset is loaded into a Pandas DataFrame (df).

Basic Information About the Dataset:-

The shape of the dataset (df.shape) is printed to reveal the number of rows (samples) and columns (features + label).
df.info() offers information on column data types and non-null counts.

Checking for Missing Values:-

The overall number of missing values in the dataset is printed.

Summary Statistics for Pixel Values:-

df.describe() calculates statistical values (mean, std, min, max, etc.) for all columns.

Pixel Value Statistics:-

A function pixel_statistics(df) takes all the pixel values (excluding the label column) and calculates:
Mean
Standard deviation
Minimum and maximum pixel value
The calculated statistics are displayed.

Displaying Sample Images from Different Labels:-

The function display_sample_images(df, num_samples=5) gets a few images for each distinct label.
Each image is reshaped into 28x28 and visualized in grayscale.
The pictures are arranged in a matrix in which the rows correspond to different labels.

Correlation Heatmap of First 20 Features:-

The first 20 columns of pixels' correlation matrix is computed.
We create a heatmap of the association among these pixel values using seaborn.
The heat map is generated using a coolwarm color.
